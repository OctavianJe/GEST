# Detailed Instructions for Narrative Generation

Below are detailed steps on how to reason in order to deconstruct the JSON and build the story. Follow these four steps precisely.

I. Identify the Core Elements.

Begin by parsing the top-level actor, object, and location entities. 
Understand who and what is in the scene and their basic properties.

II. Reconstruct the Sequence of Events.

Analyze the temporal block to understand the story's flow. 
Use the timeline to see the sequence of actions for each actor. 
Pay close attention to the relations between actions, using temporal markers. 
The temporal markers contains Allen's interval relations, which help you understand how actions relate to each other in time. 
For example, a during or contains relation is a strong signal that two events are happening concurrently and should be described together. 
An equal relation means two verbs describe the same action.

III. Incorporate Spatial and Action Details.

Flesh out the narrative using the spatial block and action properties. 
Use spatial markers to describe qualitative spatial reasoning relationships of occurred actions. 
Look for the detail field in spatial relations to add specificity. 

IV. Synthesize the Story.

Weave all the extracted information into a final narrative. 
Start with the main actions identified from the timeline and enrich them with the spatial details and concurrent events. 
Ensure the final sentences flow logically and naturally.
