Your previous response is not the expected one considering encapsulating the user's input into JSON object representation. 

This is a result of evaluating content similarity between original narrative and the recomputed one. 
The minimum allowed threshold is {{text_similarity_threshold}}.

Original user narrative input:

```str
{{original_user_input}}
```

Proposed GEST:

```json
{{proposed_gest_content}}
```

Recomputed narrative:

```str
{{recomputed_narrative}}
```

Currently, the text similarity score between the original user narrative input and the recomputed narrative is {{current_text_similarity_score}}.

You must improve the proposed GEST using ONLY the original user narrative input such that the recomputed narrative context will match the original user narrative input with a text similarity score of at least {{text_similarity_threshold}}.

Keep in mind that the output must be a valid JSON object that conforms to the JSON object representation. If the output does not match the schema, it will be considered invalid.
